### Patch Changes

- Declares the repository URL in the plain form GitHub can verify. The git+ prefix and .git suffix make GitHub treat the value as a non-GitHub source it cannot verify, which leaves the package page showing an unverified link.

- Points repository at the monorepo, where the package is now developed and released, and adds homepage pointing at the public mirror so the published metadata still links to source anyone can read.
